## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="avatar.jpg">

I am currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Financial Engineering at Cornell University. Before joining Cornell, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Finance at Nanjing University. My academic interests center around stochastic modeling and machine learning, particularly their applications in quantitative finance. I hope to leverage my skills to innovate and drive forward the field of quantitative finance, contributing to the development of financial models and strategies that can withstand the complexities of the dynamic markets. Here is a copy of my [resume](https://aolueur.github.io/resume.pdf).

In my free time, I enjoy classical music. I have been playing the violin for over 16 years and have performed in my undergraduate college orchestra and chamber music groups. I am currently working on Bach's *Partita No.2* (BWV 1004) for solo violin. If you are interested in playing chamber music with me, please feel free to reach out to me!
